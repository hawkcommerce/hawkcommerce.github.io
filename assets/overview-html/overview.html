		Here's what you need to understand and use the HawkCommerce APIs.
		Either follow the steps on this page or skip to a topic of interest using the navigation menu on the left.

	<p class="h4">What are HawkCommerce APIs?</p>
	<p>
		HawkCommerce APIs expose a range of data to third-party retail service solution providers, including store apps, multi-brand retailers, and other emerging retail-techs. These APIs are designed and documented to support core retail functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The broad categories of APIs include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Core APIs (authentication, product, search, and shopping cart) to enable third-party retail solution providers to search/get a list of products</li>
		<li>Engagement APIs (promotions, recommendations, and personalized product search) to enable retail solution providers to get personalized product details</li>
		<li>Order API to enable access to fulfillment-specific information, including store locations and order details</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<p class="h4">How to use HawkCommerce APIs</p>
	<p>
	HawkCommerce APIs can be consumed by mobile apps, web apps, and by other APIs. These APIs are built in a RESTful architectural style with data represented in JSON. Therefore, these APIs are platform agnostic when it comes to app development.
	</p>
	<p>
	Security is paramount for commerce APIs. A trusted relationship must be built between the API provider and the developer. As a third-party app provider, follow these steps to use these APIs:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Register as a developer on this portal (only private access for now, contact Sales till Dev Portal self registration hidden)</li>
		<li class="d-none">Create an app to consume the commerce APIs (not available yet)</li>
		<li>Subscribe to one or more digital products, each of which is a set of APIs grouped based on the consumption need of the third-party developer</li>
		<li>Obtain app credentials that include a Access Key for each app</li>
		<li>Use the app credentials to authenticate</li>
		<li>Try the APIs using the sandbox</li>
		<li>Make API calls from the app</li>
	</ul>

<div class="section">
	<p class="h4">Prerequisites</p>
	<p>
	Before you begin integrating the APIs into your app, be sure to have a clear understanding of your use case(s) and which APIs you'd like to use. You will also have to present necessary information and documents as part of your registration process as a developer.

	<p class="h4">Understand authentication, authorization, and consent</p>
	<p>
	There are multiple APIs available as part of this solution. Some of the APIs, such as the product API are read-only, whereas some APIs can modify data and perform transactions, such as the shopping carts API.
	</p>
	<p>
	These APIs are protected by various authentication mechanisms based on the level of access.
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>Check out</u> how authentication, authorization, and consent work.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<p class="h4">Try the sandbox</p>
	<p>
	The sandbox we've provided hosts sample data and enables you to run these APIs on the sample data. This way you can get the APIs to work and understand the request and response structure so that you can integrate them into your app after thoroughly understanding the APIs. Remember to review the documentation of each API and try them before you start using them. For your convenience, authentication, authorization, and consent has been simulated in the sandbox.
