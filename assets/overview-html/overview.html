<h3>What are commerce APIs?</h3>

Commerce APIs expose a range of data to third-party retail service solution providers, including store apps, multi-brand retailers, and other emerging retail-techs. These APIs are designed and documented to support core retail functions.

The broad categories of APIs include:

Core APIs (authentication, product, collection, search, and cart) to enable third-party retail solution providers to search/get a list of products
Engagement APIs (promotions, recommendations, and personalized product search) to enable retail solution providers to get personalized product details
Fulfillment API to enable access to fulfillment-specific information, including store locations and order details

<h3>How to use commerce APIs</h3>

Commerce APIs can be consumed by mobile apps, web apps, and by other APIs. These APIs are built in a RESTful architectural style with data represented in JSON. Therefore, these APIs are platform agnostic when it comes to app development.

Security is paramount for commerce APIs. A trusted relationship must be built between the API provider and the developer. As a third-party app provider, follow these steps to use these APIs:

Register as a developer on this portal (registration will be complete after verification)
Create an app to consume the commerce APIs
Subscribe to one or more digital products, each of which is a set of APIs grouped based on the consumption need of the third-party developer
Obtain app credentials that include a client ID and a secret for each app
Use the app credentials to authenticate
Try the APIs using the sandbox
Make API calls from the app

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

Before you begin integrating the APIs into your app, be sure to have a clear understanding of your use case(s) and which APIs you'd like to use. You will also have to present necessary information and documents as part of your app creation process.

<h3>Register with us</h3>

Click on the register button on the left top side of the portal.

<h3>Understand authentication, authorization, and consent</h3>

There are multiple commerce APIs available as part of this solution. Some of the APIs, such as the product API and the store locator API, are read-only, whereas some APIs can modify data and perform transactions, such as the carts API.

These APIs are protected by various authentication mechanisms based on the level of access.

Check out how authentication, authorization, and consent work.

<h3>Try the sandbox</h3>

The sandbox we've provided hosts sample data and enables you to run these APIs on the sample data. This way you can get the APIs to work and understand the request and response structure so that you can integrate them into your app after thoroughly understanding the APIs. Remember to review the documentation of each API and try them before you start using them. For your convenience, authentication, authorization, and consent has been simulated in the sandbox.
