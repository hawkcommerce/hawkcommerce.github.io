	<p class="h4">Overview</p>
	<p>
	We have created a sandbox environment that behaves like the APIs of a live retail. We offer all the APIs that are listed in the catalogue and data of two sample retails. Here is some key sample data that you can use in your app.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
	<p class="h4">Sample data</p>
	<p>
	Sandbox is preloaded with customers and products data.
	</p>
	<table class="table table-bordered">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Access Token</th>
				<th>Email</th>
				<th>Password</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>987654321</th>
				<th>test@nimblecommerce.com</th>
				<th>123456</th>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>
<div class="section">
	<p class="h4">Trying the APIs</p>
	<p>
	Each API can be tried using the API Explorer. You can use the sample data mentioned above and to try and test the APIs. To try the APIs, click on the particular API in the menu. You will see a tab that says "Try It Out". This section provides the ability to make API calls.
	</p>

<div class="section">
	<p class="h4">Authentication and consent</p>
	<p>
		To enable live interaction with APIs in the sandbox, we've provided an implementation of the authentication and consent app. APIs such as customer or order require explicit end-user consent to access his/her profile information. Follow these steps to authorize before you can fire the APIs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>
			Note: Authoâ€‹rization calls require a Access Token. In this case, however, we have preconfigured the flow with a Access Token, so the consent app flow is demonstrated without using a Access Token.
